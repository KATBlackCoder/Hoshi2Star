- Translation timer per file in FileTree (session only)
- Export button in toolbar with toast notifications
- Bilingual interface EN/FR with i18n (i18next)
- VRAM-based model recommendations in documentation

### Changed
- QA line length check: fixed 50-char limit replaced by pixel-based system (full-width vs half-width chars)
- Default recommended model: qwen3:4b → qwen3:4b-instruct-2507-q8_0 (instruct variant)

- ResponseFormat errors not retried (added to retry loop)
- Segments with only placeholders incorrectly extracted
- Empty and whitespace-only segments extracted
- QA panel not showing error details
- ResizablePanelGroup panels incorrectly sized (react-resizable-panels v4: numbers = px not %)
- FileTree showing icons without filenames (missing serde rename_all camelCase on Rust structs)
